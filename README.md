DiskArcher-backup-utility
=========================
A backup utility for personal use. Visual C++, MFC, ADO


I started working on it in 2001 or so. It was a shareware and some copies of it were sold.
The highest rating in search engines was being shown in the 1st page (i.e. top 10).
If you search for 'DiskArcher', there are still thousands of links to it. Although, I have not been supporting a Web site for it for many years now.

I use DiskArcher for my backups and I am proud that it is very stable and reliable.
